<br>

In the context of OSINT machines, area and event monitoring bookmarks are tools or techniques used to systematically keep track of relevant information within a specific geographical area or related to a particular event. These bookmarks help OSINT analysts stay updated on developments and changes in their areas of interest

<br>

Person of Interest Search:

<br> 

In the context of monitoring a person of interest (POI), a professional conducting OSINT may use bookmarks to organize and track relevant information efficiently.

<br> 

Remember that monitoring a person of interest requires careful consideration of legal and ethical boundaries. OSINT professionals should prioritize privacy and ensure that their actions are within the confines of the law.

<br>
